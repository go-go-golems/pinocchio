Summary: 'Investigation concludes that engine events already stream via Pinocchio SEM/websocket, while GEPA JS script event streaming requires a new host emission API and bridge integration.'

# Investigate JS VM Event Streaming to Web Frontend and SEM

## Overview

This ticket investigates whether scripts running in GEPA JS VM (for example `exp-11-coaching-dataset-generator.js`) can stream events to the web frontend using existing Pinocchio SEM infrastructure.

## Final Verdict

1. Engine/geppetto event streaming to frontend: **already works today**.
2. GEPA script-level structured event streaming: **not wired yet**.
3. Required implementation is clear and feasible: add source-side `emitEvent` API + bridge + optional projection registration.

## Primary Documents

1. `design-doc/01-gepa-event-streaming-architecture-investigation.md`
2. `reference/01-investigation-diary.md`
