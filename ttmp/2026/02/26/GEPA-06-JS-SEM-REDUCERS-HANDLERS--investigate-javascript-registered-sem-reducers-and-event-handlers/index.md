Summary: 'Clarifies current layer ownership and now includes implemented builder-owned runtime alignment across pinocchio+geppetto plus coexistence strategy for geppetto + timeline bindings in one VM.'

# Investigate JavaScript-Registered SEM Reducers and Event Handlers

## Overview

This ticket investigates where SEM projection and event reaction logic live today, and what is required to support JavaScript-registered reducers and handlers.

## High-Level Conclusions

1. `geppetto` already supports JavaScript event handlers for geppetto event stream (`start`/`partial`/`final`).
2. `pinocchio` currently performs backend SEM projection in Go; backend JS reducer registration is not present.
3. `go-go-os` app runtime already supports JS/TS SEM handler registration, but with single-handler overwrite semantics.
4. GEPA-04 streaming events are now part of the baseline and were incorporated into this analysis.

## Primary Artifacts

1. `design-doc/01-javascript-registered-sem-reducers-and-event-handler-architecture.md`
2. `reference/01-investigation-diary.md`
3. `scripts/js-sem-reducer-handler-prototype.js`

## Tracking

1. See [tasks.md](./tasks.md)
2. See [changelog.md](./changelog.md)
