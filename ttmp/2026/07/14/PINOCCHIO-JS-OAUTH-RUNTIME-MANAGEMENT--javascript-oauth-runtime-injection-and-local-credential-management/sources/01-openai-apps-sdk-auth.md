## Authenticate your users

Many Apps SDK apps can operate in a read-only, anonymous mode, but anything that exposes 
customer-specific data or write actions should authenticate users.

You can integrate with your own authorization server when you need to connect to an existing 
backend or share data between users.

## Custom auth with OAuth 2.1

For an authenticated MCP server, you are expected to implement an OAuth 2.1 flow that conforms to 
the [MCP authorization 
spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization).

### Components

- **Resource server** – your MCP server, which exposes tools and verifies access tokens on each 
request.
- **Authorization server** – your identity provider (Auth0, Okta, Cognito, or a custom 
implementation) that issues tokens and publishes discovery metadata.
- **Client** – ChatGPT acting on behalf of the user. It supports Client ID Metadata Documents 
(CIMD), dynamic client registration (DCR), predefined OAuth clients, and PKCE.

### MCP authorization spec requirements

- Host protected resource metadata on your MCP server
- Publish OAuth metadata from your authorization server
- Echo the `resource` parameter throughout the OAuth flow
- Choose how ChatGPT identifies or registers its OAuth client: CIMD, DCR, or a predefined OAuth 
client
- Publish the token endpoint authentication methods your authorization server accepts

Here is what the spec expects, in plain language.

#### Host protected resource metadata on your MCP server

- You need an HTTPS endpoint such as `GET 
https://your-mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (or advertise the same URL in a 
`WWW-Authenticate` header on `401 Unauthorized` responses) so ChatGPT knows where to fetch your 
metadata.
- That endpoint returns a JSON document describing the resource server and its available 
authorization servers:
```json
{
  "resource": "https://your-mcp.example.com",
  "authorization_servers": ["https://auth.yourcompany.com"],
  "scopes_supported": ["files:read", "files:write"],
  "resource_documentation": "https://yourcompany.com/docs/mcp"
}
```
- Key fields you must populate:
	- `resource`: the canonical HTTPS identifier for your MCP server. ChatGPT sends this exact 
value as the `resource` query parameter during OAuth.
		- `authorization_servers`: one or more issuer base URLs that point to your identity 
provider. ChatGPT will try each to find OAuth metadata.
		- `scopes_supported`: optional list that helps ChatGPT explain the permissions it 
is going to ask the user for.
		- Optional extras from [RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728) 
such as `resource_documentation`, `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`, or 
`introspection_endpoint` make it easier for clients and admins to understand your setup.

When you block a request because it is unauthenticated, return a challenge like:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer 
resource_metadata="https://your-mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource",
                         scope="files:read"
```

That single header lets ChatGPT discover the metadata URL even if it has not seen it before.

#### Publish OAuth metadata from your authorization server

- Your identity provider must expose one of the well-known discovery documents so ChatGPT can read 
its configuration:
	- OAuth 2.0 metadata at 
`https://auth.yourcompany.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
		- OpenID Connect metadata at 
`https://auth.yourcompany.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- Each document answers three big questions for ChatGPT: where to send the user, how to exchange 
codes, and how to identify itself. A typical response looks like:
```json
{
  "issuer": "https://auth.yourcompany.com",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://auth.yourcompany.com/oauth2/v1/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://auth.yourcompany.com/oauth2/v1/token",
  "client_id_metadata_document_supported": true,
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": ["none", "private_key_jwt"],
  "registration_endpoint": "https://auth.yourcompany.com/oauth2/v1/register",
  "code_challenge_methods_supported": ["S256"],
  "scopes_supported": ["files:read", "files:write"]
}
```
- Fields that must be correct:
	- `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`: the URLs ChatGPT needs to run the OAuth 
authorization-code + PKCE flow end to end.
		- `client_id_metadata_document_supported`: set to `true` when you want ChatGPT to 
use CIMD for client registration. ChatGPT prioritizes CIMD when it is available, but the app 
creator can choose DCR when both CIMD and DCR are available.
		- `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`: include the token endpoint 
authentication methods your authorization server accepts. This applies to CIMD, DCR, and predefined 
OAuth clients. For CIMD, ChatGPT supports `none` for public-client token exchange and 
`private_key_jwt` for signed client assertion token exchange. Other OAuth clients commonly use 
`none`, `client_secret_post`, or `client_secret_basic`.
		- `registration_endpoint`: include this when you support dynamic client 
registration (DCR), which lets ChatGPT create and reuse a dedicated `client_id` for the connector 
instance.
		- `code_challenge_methods_supported`: include `S256` if your authorization server 
advertises PKCE support.
		- Optional fields follow [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414) 
/ [OpenID Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html); include whatever 
helps your administrators configure policies.

#### OIDC scopes

- If your provider advertises OIDC scopes (e.g. `openid`, `email`, `profile`) in `scopes_supported` 
of its `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` or `.well-known/openid-configuration` document, 
ChatGPT requests those scopes by default during the OAuth flow.
- Some identity providers may not enable advertised OIDC scopes by default. Check your provider’s 
configuration settings and make sure every advertised scope is enabled for the OAuth client, 
whether it uses CIMD, was created manually, or was created through DCR.

#### Preserve login context during reauthorization

When ChatGPT reauthorizes an existing link, including to request additional OAuth scopes, it may 
include the prior OIDC ID token in the authorization request as the standard `id_token_hint` 
parameter. To let users grant additional scopes without starting login from scratch, configure your 
authorization server to issue an ID token during the original OAuth flow and honor `id_token_hint` 
during authorization.

This optimization is optional. Reauthorization still works when an ID token is unavailable or your 
authorization server does not use the hint.

#### Redirect URL

ChatGPT completes the OAuth flow by redirecting to 
`https://chatgpt.com/connector/oauth/{callback_id}` and the URL will be shown in the app management 
page. Add that production redirect URI to your authorization server’s allowlist so the 
authorization code can be returned successfully.

- For apps that are already published, the previous legacy redirect URI 
`https://chatgpt.com/connector_platform_oauth_redirect` continues to work.

#### Echo the resource parameter throughout the OAuth flow

- Expect ChatGPT to append `resource=https%3A%2F%2Fyour-mcp.example.com` to both the authorization 
and token requests. This ties the token back to the protected resource metadata shown above.
- Configure your authorization server to copy that value into the access token (commonly the `aud` 
claim) so your MCP server can verify the token was minted for it and nobody else.
- If a token arrives without the expected audience or scopes, reject it and rely on the 
`WWW-Authenticate` challenge to prompt ChatGPT to re-authorize with the correct parameters.

#### Support the authorization-code flow

- ChatGPT, acting as the MCP client, performs the authorization-code flow with PKCE using the 
`S256` code challenge so intercepted authorization codes cannot be replayed by an attacker.
- If your authorization server publishes `code_challenge_methods_supported`, include `S256` so 
clients can confirm PKCE support from metadata.

### OAuth flow

Provided that you have implemented the MCP authorization spec delineated above, the OAuth flow will 
be as follows:

1. ChatGPT queries your MCP server for protected resource metadata.

![](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/protected_resource_metadata.png)

2. ChatGPT identifies itself as the OAuth client. When the connector uses CIMD, ChatGPT skips 
dynamic client registration and sends a CIMD document URL as the `client_id`, such as 
`https://chatgpt.com/oauth/.../client.json` (the exact URL is specific to the MCP server because 
the redirect URI is MCP-specific). When the connector uses DCR, ChatGPT calls your authorization 
server’s `registration_endpoint` once for the connector instance, receives a generated 
`client_id`, and reuses that client for the instance.

When using CIMD, there is no client registration step. The following screen shows the DCR path:

![](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/client_registration.png)

3. When the user first invokes a tool, the ChatGPT client launches the OAuth authorization code + 
PKCE flow. The user authenticates and consents to the requested scopes.
4. ChatGPT exchanges the authorization code for an access token and attaches it to subsequent MCP 
requests (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

![](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/auth_complete.png)

5. Your server verifies the token on each request (issuer, audience, expiration, scopes) before 
executing the tool.

### Client registration

Use [Client ID Metadata Documents 
(CIMD)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#client-id-metad
ata-documents) as the preferred client registration method when your authorization server supports 
it and the app creator chooses it. With CIMD, ChatGPT uses an HTTPS metadata document URL as its 
`client_id`. Your authorization server fetches that document, validates the published client 
metadata and redirect URIs, and treats the URL as ChatGPT’s stable client identity.

If you support CIMD, set `client_id_metadata_document_supported: true` in your authorization server 
metadata. This lets ChatGPT use one stable client identity for connectors that choose CIMD, which 
your authorization server can use for redirect URI allowlists, rate limits, and other policies.

ChatGPT’s production CIMD document advertises both supported client authentication methods using 
the [OpenID Connect RP Metadata 
Choices](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rp-metadata-choices-1_0-final.html) client 
metadata field:

```json
{
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": ["none", "private_key_jwt"]
}
```

The same field name has different perspectives in the two documents: in authorization server 
metadata, it lists the methods your token endpoint accepts; in ChatGPT’s CIMD document, it lists 
the methods ChatGPT can use. The `client_id` URL is stable and does not use query parameters to 
select a method-specific document. At runtime, ChatGPT compares both lists and prefers the stronger 
`private_key_jwt` method when your authorization server supports it; otherwise, it uses `none`.

The supported methods are:

- `none`: use this public-client flow when your token endpoint supports PKCE-based 
authorization-code exchange without client authentication. ChatGPT does not store a per-client 
secret.
- `private_key_jwt`: use this signed client assertion flow when your token endpoint requires client 
authentication. ChatGPT publishes a public JWKS URL in its CIMD metadata. The JWKS is served from 
`/oauth/jwks.json` on the metadata origin. ChatGPT signs token requests server-side with a managed 
private key and `kid`; your authorization server verifies the assertion against the public JWKS.

DCR is still supported. If you include `registration_endpoint`, ChatGPT can register dynamically 
when the app creator chooses DCR or CIMD is not available. ChatGPT runs DCR once per app instance, 
then keeps and reuses the registered OAuth client for that instance. DCR can still create many 
registered clients across many separate app instances, so CIMD is usually easier to administer at 
scale.

### Client identification

A frequent question is how your MCP server can confirm that a request actually comes from ChatGPT. 
ChatGPT presents an OpenAI-managed client certificate when connecting to MCP servers, so you can 
verify the client at the transport layer with mTLS. You can also allowlist ChatGPT’s [published 
egress IP ranges](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/ip-addresses). ChatGPT does **not** 
support machine-to-machine OAuth grants such as client credentials, service accounts, or JWT bearer 
assertions, nor can it present custom API keys or customer-provided mTLS certificates.

CIMD further strengthens client identification by giving your authorization server a stable, 
HTTPS-hosted declaration of ChatGPT’s identity. When you use `private_key_jwt`, verify 
ChatGPT’s token endpoint client assertion against the public JWKS published in the CIMD metadata.

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

ChatGPT now presents an OpenAI-managed client certificate when establishing TLS connections to MCP 
servers. If your application validates client certificates, configure it to trust the OpenAI 
certificate chain below.

- [
	Download OpenAI Root CA
	](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/mtls/openai-root-ca.pem)
- [
	Download OpenAI Connectors mTLS intermediate CA
	](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/mtls/openai-connectors-mtls-ca.pem)

To validate the client certificate when establishing the TLS connection to your MCP server:

- Verify a leaf certificate is present and chains to the OpenAI Connectors mTLS intermediate CA.
- Verify the leaf certificate is valid for client authentication.
- Verify the leaf certificate’s SAN `dnsName` is `mtls.prod.connectors.openai.com`.
- Avoid pinning a leaf certificate fingerprint; OpenAI may rotate the leaf certificate while 
keeping it under the published CA chain.

Use mTLS to authenticate ChatGPT as the MCP client. Continue to use OAuth 2.1 to authenticate the 
end user and authorize tool access.

### Choosing an identity provider

Most OAuth 2.1 identity providers can satisfy the MCP authorization requirements once they expose a 
discovery document, support CIMD with `none` or `private_key_jwt`, support DCR when needed, and 
echo the `resource` parameter into issued tokens. Prefer providers that support CIMD for client 
registration.

We *strongly* recommend that you use an existing established identity provider rather than 
implementing authentication from scratch yourself.

Here are instructions for some popular identity providers.

#### Auth0

Auth0 enables MCP clients to securely connect to MCP servers by providing metadata discovery, CIMD 
registration, API security, and token exchange for first- and third-party tool calls.

SDK](https://stytch.com/blog/guide-to-authentication-for-the-openai-apps-sdk/)

### Implementing token verification

When the OAuth flow finishes, ChatGPT simply attaches the access token it received to subsequent 
MCP requests (`Authorization: Bearer …`). Once a request reaches your MCP server you must assume 
the token is untrusted and perform the full set of resource-server checks yourself—signature 
validation, issuer and audience matching, expiry, replay considerations, and scope enforcement. 
That responsibility sits with you, not with ChatGPT.

In practice you should:

- Fetch the signing keys published by your authorization server (usually via JWKS) and verify the 
token’s signature and `iss`.
- Reject tokens that have expired or have not yet become valid (`exp` / `nbf`).
- Confirm the token was minted for your server (`aud` or the `resource` claim) and contains the 
scopes you marked as required.
- Run any app-specific policy checks, then either attach the resolved identity to the request 
context or return a `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge.

If verification fails, respond with `401 Unauthorized` and a `WWW-Authenticate` header that points 
back to your protected-resource metadata. This tells the client to run the OAuth flow again.

#### SDK token verification primitives

Both Python and TypeScript MCP SDKs include helpers so you do not have to wire this from scratch.

- [Python](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#authentication)
- 
[TypeScript](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#proxy-authori
zation-requests-upstream)

## Testing and rollout

- **Local testing** – start with a development tenant that issues short-lived tokens so you can 
iterate quickly.
- **Dogfood** – once authentication works, gate access to trusted testers before rolling out 
broadly. You can require linking for specific tools or the entire connector.
- **Rotation** – plan for token revocation, refresh, and scope changes. Your server should treat 
missing or stale tokens as unauthenticated and return a helpful error message.
- **OAuth debugging** – use the [MCP 
Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) Auth settings to walk through each 
OAuth step and pinpoint where the flow breaks before you ship.

With authentication in place you can confidently expose user-specific data and write actions to 
ChatGPT users.

## Triggering authentication UI

ChatGPT only surfaces its OAuth linking UI when your MCP server signals that OAuth is available or 
necessary.

Triggering the tool-level OAuth flow requires both metadata (`securitySchemes` and the resource 
metadata document) **and** runtime errors that carry `_meta["mcp/www_authenticate"]`. Without both 
halves ChatGPT will not show the linking UI for that tool.

1. **Publish resource metadata.** The MCP server must expose its OAuth configuration at a 
well-known URL such as `https://your-mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`.
2. **Describe each tool’s auth policy with `securitySchemes`.** Declaring `securitySchemes` per 
tool tells ChatGPT which tools require OAuth versus which can run anonymously. Stick to per-tool 
declarations even if the entire server uses the same policy; server-level defaults make it 
difficult to evolve individual tools later.
	Two scheme types are available today, and you can list more than one to express optional 
auth:
	- `noauth` — the tool is callable anonymously; ChatGPT can run it immediately.
		- `oauth2` — the tool needs an OAuth 2.0 access token; include the scopes you 
will request so the consent screen is accurate.
	If you omit the array entirely, the tool inherits whatever default the server advertises. 
Declaring both `noauth` and `oauth2` tells ChatGPT it can start with anonymous calls but that 
linking unlocks privileged behavior. Regardless of what you signal to the client, your server must 
still verify the token, scopes, and audience on every invocation.
	Example (public + optional auth) – TypeScript SDK
	```ts
	import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
	import { z } from "zod";
	declare const server: McpServer;
	server.registerTool(
	  "search",
	  {
	    title: "Public Search",
	    description: "Search public documents.",
	    inputSchema: {
	      q: z.string(),
	    },
	    outputSchema: {},
	    securitySchemes: [
	      { type: "noauth" },
	      { type: "oauth2", scopes: ["search.read"] },
	    ],
	  },
	  async ({ q }) => {
	    return {
	      content: [{ type: "text", text: \`Results for ${q}\` }],
	      structuredContent: {},
	    };
	  }
	);
	```
	Example (auth required) – TypeScript SDK
	```ts
	import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
	import { z } from "zod";
	declare const server: McpServer;
	server.registerTool(
	  "create_doc",
	  {
	    title: "Create Document",
	    description: "Make a new doc in your account.",
	    inputSchema: {
	      title: z.string(),
	    },
	    outputSchema: {},
	    securitySchemes: [{ type: "oauth2", scopes: ["docs.write"] }],
	  },
	  async ({ title }) => {
	    return {
	      content: [{ type: "text", text: \`Created doc: ${title}\` }],
	      structuredContent: {},
	    };
	  }
	);
	```
3. **Check tokens inside the tool handler and emit `_meta["mcp/www_authenticate"]`** when you want 
ChatGPT to trigger the authentication UI. Inspect the token and verify issuer, audience, expiry, 
and scopes. If no valid token is present, return an error result that includes 
`_meta["mcp/www_authenticate"]` and make sure the value contains both an `error` and 
`error_description` parameter. This `WWW-Authenticate` payload is what actually triggers the 
tool-level OAuth UI once steps 1 and 2 are in place. When a challenge prompts reauthorization, your 
provider can [preserve the user’s existing login 
context](#preserve-login-context-during-reauthorization) during that flow.
	Example
	```json
	{
	  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
	  "id": 4,
	  "result": {
	    "content": [
	      {
	        "type": "text",
	        "text": "Authentication required: no access token provided."
	      }
	    ],
	    "_meta": {
	      "mcp/www_authenticate": [
	        "'Bearer 
resource_metadata=\"https://your-mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\", 
error=\"insufficient_scope\", error_description=\"You need to login to continue\"'"
	      ]
	    },
	    "isError": true
	  }
	}
	```
