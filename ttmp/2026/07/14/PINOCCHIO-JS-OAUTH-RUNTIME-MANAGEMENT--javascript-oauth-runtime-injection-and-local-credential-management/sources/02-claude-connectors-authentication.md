Authentication is the most common source of partner questions. Claude’s auth support differs in a 
few places from the generic MCP specification, so read this page even if you’re already familiar 
with MCP auth.

## Supported authentication types

Claude supports the following authentication types for remote MCP servers. The same infrastructure 
backs Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude mobile, Claude Code, and Cowork.

| Type | Description | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oauth_dcr` | OAuth 2.0 with Dynamic Client Registration ([RFC 
7591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591)) | Supported out of the box |
| `oauth_cimd` | OAuth 2.0 with [Client ID Metadata 
Document](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#client-id-met
adata-documents) | Supported out of the box |
| `oauth_anthropic_creds` | OAuth 2.0 with Anthropic-held client credentials | Contact 
`mcp-review@anthropic.com` |
| `custom_connection` | Custom URL or credentials supplied at connection time (for example, 
Snowflake-style) | Contact `mcp-review@anthropic.com` |
| `static_headers` | Fixed credential (API key or bearer token) entered by an organization 
administrator as a request header when adding the connector | Beta |
| `none` | No authentication (authless server) | Supported. An optional partial-auth mode is 
experimental. |

Static bearer tokens and API keys are supported in beta through request headers (`static_headers`). 
An organization administrator enters the credential once when adding the connector, and Claude 
sends it on every request. The credential is shared by the organization rather than pasted per 
user. See [Authenticating with request 
headers](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/custom/remote-mcp#authenticating-with-request-headers) 
for what administrators see and how to document the expected header for them.

Tokens or API keys passed in the connector URL (for example, `?token=`, `?apiKey=`, or 
`?userToken=` query parameters) are **not recommended**. A credential in a URL is a security 
vulnerability: URLs are routinely recorded in server logs, proxies, and browsing history, so a 
query-string credential is easy to leak. The MCP authorization specification explicitly [prohibits 
access tokens in the URI query 
string](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#token-requireme
nts). Use OAuth or [request 
headers](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/custom/remote-mcp#authenticating-with-request-headers) 
instead.

## Anthropic-held client credentials

A pure machine-to-machine `client_credentials` grant—where a server-to-server token is issued 
with no user in the loop—is **not supported**. Every connection requires user consent.

`oauth_anthropic_creds` is the consent-gated alternative. The flow works like this:

1. You create an OAuth `client_id` and `client_secret` in your own authorization server and send 
them to Anthropic.
2. Anthropic stores those credentials securely and associates them with your directory entry.
3. When a user connects your server, they go through a standard OAuth consent screen.
4. After consent, Anthropic uses the stored client credentials to complete the token exchange on 
the user’s behalf.

This gives you a stable, registered OAuth client without requiring DCR or CIMD on your end, while 
keeping the user-consent step. Anthropic stores your credentials securely and uses them only for 
token exchange on behalf of consenting users; they are shared across the hosted Claude surfaces 
(Claude.ai web, Desktop, mobile, and Cowork). Claude Code runs its own OAuth flow on the user’s 
machine and identifies itself with its own [Client ID Metadata Document](#callback-urls), so it 
does not use Anthropic-held credentials. Claude Managed Agents uses a separate credential set.

Anthropic-held credentials are bound to the authorization server that issued them. If you migrate 
to a new authorization server, email `mcp-review@anthropic.com` with the new `client_id` and 
`client_secret` before cutting over. CIMD-based connectors don’t have this constraint — a CIMD 
`client_id` is a self-hosted URL, so it works against any authorization server that fetches it.

To use this flow, email `mcp-review@anthropic.com` with your `client_id` and secret.

## DCR and CIMD details

If your authorization server does **not** expose a `registration_endpoint` (i.e., does not support 
DCR), you have several options:

- Expose a `registration_endpoint`
- Support CIMD instead. Claude selects CIMD only when your authorization server metadata advertises 
**both** `"client_id_metadata_document_supported": true` **and** `"none"` in 
`token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` — the second is required because Claude’s CIMD client 
authenticates as a public client at your token endpoint. If either is missing, Claude falls back to 
DCR. See [lazy 
authentication](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/lazy-authentication#identify-the-client-
with-cimd) for a worked CIMD example.
- Switch to `oauth_anthropic_creds`

For servers expecting high traffic from the directory, prefer **CIMD or `oauth_anthropic_creds` 
over DCR**. DCR causes Claude to register a new client on every fresh connection, which can result 
in very large numbers of registered clients on your authorization server. CIMD and Anthropic-held 
credentials avoid the registration call entirely.

Claude includes a [PKCE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) `code_challenge` with 
`code_challenge_method=S256` on every authorization request, regardless of which registration 
mechanism it uses. Your authorization server must support S256 PKCE, and the [MCP authorization 
spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#authorization-cod
e-protection) requires it to advertise `"code_challenge_methods_supported": ["S256"]` in its 
metadata so spec-compliant clients can verify support before starting the flow.

To control which scopes Claude requests, include a `scope` parameter in the `WWW-Authenticate` 
header on your `401` response. If you don’t, Claude requests the scopes your protected resource 
metadata advertises in `scopes_supported`. Claude also appends `offline_access` when your 
authorization server metadata lists it in `scopes_supported`, to obtain a refresh token. See [lazy 
authentication](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/lazy-authentication#return-401-not-a-too
l-error) for the canonical `401` shape.

## Cross-host authorization servers

A cross-host authorization server doesn’t need anything special on its own. The 
`authorization_servers` field in your [protected resource 
metadata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9728) tells Claude where the authorization server is, 
and Claude resolves it regardless of which host it points at. The thing to get right is making sure 
Claude can find the protected resource metadata in the first place.

**Always return a `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header** whose `resource_metadata` parameter 
points at your protected resource metadata document — the same handshake described in [Return 
401, not a tool 
error](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/lazy-authentication#return-401-not-a-tool-error):

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer 
resource_metadata="https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"
```

The `401` status is required — Claude does not honor a `WWW-Authenticate` header on a `200` 
response — and the `resource_metadata` URL doesn’t have to be on the MCP server’s origin; it 
can be any HTTPS location that serves the JSON document. That’s what makes this the most reliable 
path for hosting platforms that can’t serve `/.well-known/*` at the root, such as Supabase Edge 
Functions, Cloudflare Workers without a `/.well-known/*` route, and Lambda function URLs that only 
route a path prefix.

If your `401` doesn’t include a `resource_metadata` pointer, Claude can still infer the metadata 
location by probing your MCP server’s origin: 
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/<your-mcp-path>` first, then 
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`. Treat this as a fallback — it only works when your 
platform serves `/.well-known/*` paths, and it adds round-trips to every connection.

Whichever way Claude finds the document:

- The protected resource metadata document’s `resource` field must match your MCP server URL 
exactly as the user enters it in Claude, including any path component.
- The metadata’s `authorization_servers` field must list your authorization server’s issuer 
URL. If you list more than one, Claude uses the first entry and does not fall back to later entries 
— list your primary issuer first.
- Your authorization server must serve its own discovery metadata — [RFC 
8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414) authorization server metadata or [OpenID Connect 
Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) — at its 
`/.well-known/` paths, and that host must also be reachable from Anthropic’s [published egress 
range](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/ip-addresses). Discovery requests to the 
authorization server come from the same IP range as requests to your MCP server, so a WAF in front 
of your identity provider can break the flow even when your MCP server is reachable.

If your authorization server is Microsoft Entra ID, you must also register the MCP server URL as an 
Application ID URI on your Entra app registration, or the token request fails with `AADSTS9010010`. 
See [the troubleshooting 
entry](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/troubleshooting#microsoft-entra-id-rejects-the-re
source-value) for the fix.

If you control both hosts, an alternative is to serve the MCP endpoint and the authorization server 
behind a single custom domain that can route both `/.well-known/*` and your MCP path.

A common symptom of a discovery failure is that your MCP server receives the initial request but 
your authorization server sees no traffic at all. That happens when neither path works: there’s 
no `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=…` header on your `401`, and the well-known paths 
on your MCP server’s origin return `404`. With no metadata to read, Claude never learns where 
your authorization server is, and the connection fails with “Couldn’t reach the MCP server.” 
See [troubleshooting](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/troubleshooting) for the full 
diagnostic flow.

## Callback URLs

For the hosted Claude surfaces (Claude.ai web, Desktop, mobile, and Cowork), register the following 
redirect URI:

```text
https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback
```

**Claude Code** is a native client and uses an RFC 8252 loopback redirect on an ephemeral port — 
for example:

```text
http://localhost:3118/callback
```

The port varies per session. Claude Code declares `http://localhost/callback` and 
`http://127.0.0.1/callback` in its [Client ID Metadata 
Document](https://claude.ai/oauth/claude-code-client-metadata), so your authorization server must 
accept both with the port component ignored. [RFC 8252 section 
7.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252#section-7.3) requires this for the IP-literal 
form (`127.0.0.1`); apply the same port-agnostic match to `localhost` so Claude Code works, even 
though RFC 8252 section 8.3 discourages `localhost`. See [lazy 
authentication](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/lazy-authentication) for implementation 
details.

A Client ID Metadata Document can’t prevent loopback impersonation on its own — any local 
process can bind a port and claim to be the legitimate client. The [MCP authorization 
spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#localhost-redirec
t-uri-risks) requires authorization servers to display the redirect URI hostname clearly on the 
consent screen and recommends an extra warning when the only registered redirect URIs are loopback 
addresses.

## Token refresh

Claude refreshes tokens **reactively on a 401 response**, with a proactive refresh up to five 
minutes before the stored expiry. To avoid refresh failures:

- Return RFC 6749-compliant error codes (`invalid_grant`, not `invalid_request` or a custom code) 
when a refresh token is no longer valid
- Rotate refresh tokens for public-client connections. DCR and CIMD register Claude as a public 
client, and the [MCP authorization 
spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#token-theft) 
adopts OAuth 2.1’s requirement to rotate or sender-constrain refresh tokens for public clients. 
If you rotate, return the new refresh token in the same response that invalidates the old one.

Your `/token` endpoint must accept `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` per [RFC 6749 
section 4.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1.3). Claude sends both the initial 
token exchange and refresh requests with this content type. Some web frameworks default to 
JSON-only body parsing—if your endpoint returns `415 Unsupported Media Type`, register a 
form-urlencoded body parser. Dynamic client registration (`/register`) uses `application/json` per 
[RFC 7591 section 3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591#section-3.1), so don’t assume the 
same parser works for both.

## Enterprise authentication

Organizations using SSO can also connect their users to your server without an interactive OAuth 
consent step, using an identity assertion signed by their identity provider. See [Enterprise 
Managed Auth](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/enterprise-managed-auth) for what your 
authorization server needs to support.

Directory connectors use a **single shared OAuth application per connector**. There is no per-org 
OAuth client for directory connectors — enterprise customers connect to the same OAuth app as 
everyone else, and access is scoped by the user’s own permissions on your service. Custom 
connectors are different: an admin can supply their own OAuth client credentials when adding the 
connector, which scopes the OAuth client to that organization. See [custom 
connectors](#custom-connectors).

## Custom connectors

When a user adds a custom connector by URL, the OAuth Client Secret field is **optional**. Supply 
it only if your authorization server requires confidential-client authentication.

Supplying your own pre-registered client ID (and secret, if your server requires one) as static 
client credentials is a good option when you want a stable OAuth client per organization: it avoids 
dynamic client registration entirely, and the credentials are scoped to the organization that 
entered them.

For servers that authenticate with a fixed API key or token rather than OAuth, request header 
authentication (`static_headers`) is available in beta. See [Supported authentication 
types](#supported-authentication-types) above and [Authenticating with request 
headers](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/custom/remote-mcp#authenticating-with-request-headers) 
for what administrators see.

## Endpoint latency

Claude waits up to **10 seconds** for a response from your OAuth discovery, registration, and token 
endpoints, and up to **30 seconds** for refresh token requests. If no response arrives within that 
window the flow is treated as a failure, even if your server eventually completes the request. Aim 
well under these limits; a token endpoint that takes several seconds to respond will produce 
intermittent connection failures for users.

If your token endpoint depends on slow downstream calls, return the HTTP response headers and body 
without buffering behind upstream work, and check that any reverse proxy, API gateway, or WAF in 
front of the endpoint isn’t holding the response.

## Network reference

Anthropic’s outbound traffic to your server originates from `160.79.104.0/21`. See the [IP 
address reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/ip-addresses) if you need to allowlist 
Anthropic for conditional access or firewall rules.
