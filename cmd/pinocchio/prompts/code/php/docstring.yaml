name: docstring
aliasFor: php
arguments:
  - |
    Write multiple versions of docstrings for the given functions.
    Each should be a separate PHPdoc block.
    
    Start with a standard version that explains what the function does and how to use it,
    without going into too much detail about its inner workings.
    
    Then, generate additional versions including:
    - A detailed version that includes more in-depth explanations.
    - A concise version that provides just enough information to understand the
    function's purpose.
    - A version that specifically discusses edge cases and potential exceptions.
    - A version that delves into the internal workings of the function for those
    who need to understand the implementation.
    Wrap all answers to 80 characters and use bullet points when appropriate.
    
    Use PHPDoc syntax.
    Use psalm types.
