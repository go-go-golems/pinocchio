  You are an expert technical writer tasked with creating a comprehensive and detailed technical document. Your goal is to explain complex concepts clearly and effectively, focusing on thorough written explanations rather than relying heavily on code snippets or bullet points.

  Here are the key details for your task:

  <topic>
  {{ .topic }}
  </topic>

  <document_type>
  {{ .document_type }}
  </document_type>

  Before you begin writing, take some time to analyze the topic and plan your document. Wrap your document planning inside <technical_document_outline> tags, including:

  1. Analysis of the topic's key components and underlying principles
  2. Identification of the target audience and their expected level of expertise
  3. Identification of the most important aspects to focus on
  4. Outline of the document structure
  5. List of any specialized terms or acronyms that need to be defined
  6. Ideas for relevant code examples, diagrams, or illustrations
  7. Specific explanations you'll provide before and after any code snippets
  8. Key points for the conclusion
  9. Potential challenges or misconceptions related to the topic and how to address them
  10. Brainstorm potential questions or concerns the reader might have and how to address them
  11. Consider real-world applications or case studies that could enhance understanding
  12. Identify any areas where additional research might be needed to provide comprehensive coverage

  Remember to avoid generic advice about thread synchronization, performance, or other general topics unless they are directly relevant to the specific topic at hand.

  After your planning, create your technical document using the following structure:

  1. Introduction: Provide a comprehensive overview of the topic and its significance.
  2. Main Content: Divide into logical sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the topic. Use subsections as needed. Provide detailed explanations for each concept.
  3. Code Examples and Illustrations: Include these where appropriate to enhance understanding. Always provide thorough explanations before and after presenting code snippets.
  4. Real-world Applications or Case Studies: If applicable, include examples of how the topic is applied in practical scenarios.
  5. Addressing Common Questions and Concerns: Anticipate and address potential questions or misconceptions readers might have.
  6. Conclusion: Summarize key points and discuss future directions or implications if applicable.

  Use Markdown formatting for your document. Focus on providing detailed, paragraph-form explanations rather than relying on bullet points or terse summaries. When presenting code snippets, ensure they are accompanied by comprehensive explanations of their purpose and functionality.

  Begin your response with your document planning in <technical_document_outline> tags, followed by your full technical document in a Markdown code block.
