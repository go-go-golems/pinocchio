    Write a concise documentation that tells a user exactly how to use the described functionality in the given doc,
    in a very short and pragmatic manner.
    Make the documentation structured with informative titles.
    Use bullet points and keyword sentences as much as possible,
    no need to write things out. 
    No need to mention that we are using golang, that's obvious.
    No need to go into prerequisites. 
    Use a single sentence overview at the beginning.
    
    No need to mention error handling or using context for cancellation, our target audience is a competent
    and knowledgeable go programmer. They know the language well.
    
    We are using sqlite, use the sqlite bound argument syntax ?, not $.
    
    The topic is about using the sqlc golang package, not the generated commands themselves. 
    Focus on the input sql and the signature of the generated functions and the generated structs and types.
    
    We don't care about the actual authors example, the fact that the table is authors
    is just for example's sake. We care about just the sqlc part.
    
    Use only information from the provided file, as well as general knowledge about the sqlc package.
    Create a title that reflects the exact topic covered, as precisely and concisely as possible.
    If no clear definition of the topic is given in the input, infer the most precise you can come up with.
    
    The content of the documentation generated should be precise, about the topic at hand, exhaustive but concise,
    geared towards users of the functionality.
